# Autoregressive network on 2D Ising model
Aims to construct autoregressive networks (PixelCNN and similar) that outputs the log probabilities of configurations (and samples from it), given by Boltzmann distribution for Ising model to arbitrary accuracy. This uses Tensorflow 2 on a Jupyter notebook.
